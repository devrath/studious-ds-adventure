## `Complexities`

| ðŸ†‚ðŸ…¿ðŸ…°ðŸ…²ðŸ…´ | ðŸ†ƒðŸ…¸ðŸ…¼ðŸ…´ |
| -------- | ------- |
|  O(1)    |   O(log3n)  |


## `Approach`
* Instead of dividing the array into `2-parts`, We divide the array into `3-parts`
* How to calculate on which position we need to set the points to divide the array
  * We first calculate the ---------> ```partitionSize = (right - left) / 3```
  * Calculate first mid-point ------> ```mid1 = left + partitionSize```
  * Calculate second mid-point ---> ```mid2 = right - partitionSize```

## `Is Ternary Search faster than Binary Search`
* No
