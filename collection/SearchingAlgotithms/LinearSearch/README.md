## `Complexities`

| ğŸ†‚ğŸ…¿ğŸ…°ğŸ…²ğŸ…´ | ğŸ†ƒğŸ…¸ğŸ…¼ğŸ…´ |
| -------- | ------- |
|  O(1)    |   O(n)  |


## `Approach`
* We have an array, We iterate the array by checking if the element is present
* If the element is found we return the index of the element
* If the element is not found then we return `-1`

## `Disadvantages`
* It is not a good approach for large data sets. Since the time complexity increases as the size of the data set increases
