## `Approach`
* It is the simplest of sorting techniques.
* We would be given an array of unsorted numbers, We need to sort them in ascending order.
* Here we scan the items from left to right, If the order is different, We swap them.

### `Steps`
* The data set is `[8,2,4,1,3]`
* When the first iteration is complete, The output is `[2,4,1,3,8]`
* So at each iteration the largest element reaches the end of the array, Thus we will need multiple iterations to sort the elements completely.
* Now on each new iteration, we know highest element reaches to end so in the new new iteration, one comparision should be less to be more efficient.
