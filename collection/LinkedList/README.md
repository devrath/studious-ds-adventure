### `Comparing linked list with array list `
* An array list is the data structure linked list commonly compared with because `linked list` is `dynamic in length` just like the `array list` but the arrays are fixed in length. 
* In the `linked list` we cannot go to a particular position based on the index.
* In the `array list`, all the elements are in a contiguous place in the memory but in the `linked list` the elements are spread out.

### `Structure of array list`

* Note that the elements are stored continuously in the memory.
* We have access to the index

### `Structure of linked list`

* Observe that each node has a field that points to the next node.
* There is a pointer called `head` that points to the first node.
* There is a pointer called `tail` that points to the last node.
* The last node points to `null` indicating that it is the end of the node and null states it does not point to anything but since there is a variable, we add null to it.
* Observe that it is not contiguous memory locations but rather is distributed throughout the memory locations.
