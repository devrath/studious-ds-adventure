## 🚴 `Checking if a String is Palindrome or not`

### `What is a palindrome`
A palindrome is a string when we read from the beginning or the end of the string, it reads the same

### `Different approaches to solving the problem`
#### `Using the stack`
* Here it works but it takes extra space 
* Here time complexity is in `O(n)`
* But Space complexity is alo `O(n)`
#### `Using sliding window technique`
* Here it is the best approach since we can use 2 pointers to solve the problem by moving both of them on either side and comparing them
* Here time complexity is in `O(n)`
* But Space complexity is alo `O(n)`
