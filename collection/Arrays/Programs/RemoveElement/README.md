## ðŸ“º  `Remove element`

### ðŸ§¿ `Problem`
* There is `array` given and a `number` is given as input.
* We need to remove all the occurrences of `number` meaning the integer value printed indicates the elements that are there that do not contain the `number`.

### :electron: `Algorithm`
* We use two pointers, `left-pointer` we keep at the beginning of the array, and the `right-pointer` we keep at the end of the array.
* We use a loop until `left-pointer` is less than the `right-pointer`.
* We keep moving the `left-pointer` until the `left-pointer` is not equal to `target-element`.
* If the `left-pointer` is equal to `target-element` perform the swap and decrement the `right-pointer`.
* Finally we increment the counter of `left-pointer` by one and return the result because the array starts from zero.
  
### ðŸ§ª `TestCases`
**Example 1:**
```kotlin
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```
**Example 2:**
```kotlin
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```
