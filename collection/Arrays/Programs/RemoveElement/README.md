## ðŸ“º  `Remove element`

### ðŸ§¿ `Problem`
* There is `array` given and a `number` is given as input.
* We need to remove all the occurrences of `number` meaning the integer value printed indicates the elements that are there that does not contain the `number`.

### ðŸ§ª `TestCases`
**Example 1:**
```kotlin
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```
**Example 2:**
```kotlin
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
