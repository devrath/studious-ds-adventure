## üì∫ `Problem statement`
Reversing the strings using the stack  

## üìü `Output`
```kotlin
Initial String---> Hello
Final String---> olleH
```

## üß≠ `Complexity`
* `TimeComplexity` - O(n)
* `SpaceComplexity` - O(n)

## ‚õ∞Ô∏è `Explanation`
* Time complexity is `O(n)` because there are two loops involved.
* Space complexity is `O(n)` because there is extra space occupied by stack to store the characters.
