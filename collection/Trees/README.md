* `Trees` come under the non-linear data structures.
* The elements here are organized in the form of a hierarchy.
* The elements are called `NODES` and the lines that connect them are called `EDGES`.
* Each node contains data, In the diagram above we have integers, But in the real world, we can have objects.
* The parent most node is called as the `ROOT` node, and the end elements are called `LEAF` nodes.
