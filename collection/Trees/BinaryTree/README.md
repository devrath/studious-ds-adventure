## `What is a binary tree`

* A tree is called a binary tree if the data is organized in a hierarchical structure and a `node` has two children namely `left` and `right`.
* There can be max of two children for a node and a node can have one child or no child also.
* The elements to the left of the node are called the `left-subtree` of that node and the elements to the right of the node are called the `right-subtree` of that node.

## `What is binary search tree(BST)`

</div>

* A tree is called a binary search tree if it is fundamentally a binary tree meaning it has 2 children only.
* All the elements in the left sub-tree are lesser than the node under consideration.
* Subsequently all the elements in the right sub-tree are greater than the node under consideration.
* The left and right sub-tree must also be a binary search tree.
* The entire tree must not contain any duplicate nodes.

In a `normal tree`, A node can have `n-children` but in a `binary tree` a node can have a maximum of two children, also no children, just one child.

* `Duplicates`
  *  Binary Tree -> Contains duplicates.
  *  Binary search tree -> Does not contain duplicates.
* `Time complexity`
  * Binary Tree -> Its slower around order `O(n)`
  * Binary search tree -> It is faster since its ordered and of `O(nlogn)`
