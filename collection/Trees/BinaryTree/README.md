* A tree is called a binary tree if the data is organized in a hierarchical structure and a `node` has two children namely `left` and `right`.
* There can be max of two children for a node and a node can have one child or no child also.
* The elements to the left of the node are called the `left-subtree` of that node and the elements to the right of the node are called the `right-subtree` of that node.

In a `normal tree`, A node can have `n-children` but in a `binary tree` a node can have a maximum of two children, also no children, just one child.
