* A tree is called a heap if it's complete & Satisfies the heap property.
  * If it has to be complete, Then it should satisfy the below conditions.
    * If all the nodes are filled apart from the leaves.
    * Every level except the last level must be full of nodes.
    * Also the elements are filled from left to right.
  * If the heap needs to satisfy the heap property.
    * If we pick any node, All its children must be less than the node under consideration.
